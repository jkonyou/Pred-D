# PRED-D: Predictive Diagnostics by Design

PRED-D is an Pyhsics layered with  AI-powered diagnostics system for early failure detection in industrial, marine, and  munncupal infrastructure machinery.  
It uses vibration, WiFi signal anomalies, and acoustic signatures to detect faults — before they become catastrophic.

## 🚀 Vision

> “Forgiveness before failure.”  
PRED-D was built to predict, prevent, and forgive machine failures before they cost lives or downtime.

## 🧠 Features

- Hybrid app to log vibration, WiFi, and sound data
- Real-time anomaly detection using machine learning
- CSV and sensor data visualizer
- Pipe choke/leakage detection system (coming soon)
- Modular architecture for plug-and-play diagnostics
